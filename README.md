[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3bafbe6a3bfb420282e57c2b89b0a5bf)](https://www.codacy.com/app/mommi84/horn-concerto?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=mommi84/horn-concerto&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

To install Horn Concerto, clone its repository and cd into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mommi84/horn-concerto.git
cd horn-concerto
```

## Mining existing endpoints

The current algorithm works with any SPARQL endpoint. To test it, run it with:

```bash
python horn_concerto_parallel.py
```

This will start a rule-mining task on http://dbpedia.org/sparql using default parameter values. Rules will be saved in files as `rules-*.tsv`.


## Mining data dumps

If your data is only available as RDF dump, install Virtuoso through Docker. Admin rights might be needed.

```bash
bash install-virtuoso.sh
```

After launching the Docker instance with `docker start virtuoso`, install a graph by launching:

```bash
bash install-graph.sh filename.nt http://desired.graph.name
bash install-graph.exec
```

and finally launch the mining phase with:

```bash
python horn_concerto_parallel.py http://localhost:8890/sparql http://desired.graph.name MIN_CONFIDENCE N_PROPERTIES N_TRIANGLES OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

where `MIN_CONFIDENCE` belongs to inteval [0,1] (default=0.001), `N_PROPERTIES` is the number of top properties to consider (default=100), `N_TRIANGLES` is the number of top properties closing a 3-clique (default=10).

Rules will be saved in files as `OUTPUT_FOLDER/rules-*.tsv`.

## Inference

Horn Concerto can infer new triples in the graph using the previously discovered rules.

```bash
python horn_concerto_inference.py ENDPOINT GRAPH_NAME RULES_FOLDER INFER_FUN
```

where `INFER_FUN` is the inference function which can have the following values: `A` (average), `M` (maximum), `P` (opposite product). Discovered triples and their confidence values will be found in file `inferred_triples_*.txt`.
